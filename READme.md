# Project Title

Week 1 Assignment: Horiseon Website Update

## Description
The purpose of this READme is to detail the changes and updates to the site that have taken place.

### This repository contains:
* A READme file detailing the assignment and what the changes of the website are
Html.index file
* Assets folder that contains the following:
* Png file of the expected mock up
* Assignment criteria folder that contains the original READme file with the objectives of the assignment
* Css folder containing css style sheet
* Images for the site

This website had already been created however there were a number of things that needed changing from the clients request.

## Client Changes Requested
* Write code so the sit is web accessible
* Rewrite the code to be cleaner and follow correct semantic layout
* Reduce unnecessary CSS code by creating classes to avoid doubling up on code
* Fix links that don’t work
* Add alt tags to images
* Leaving the Site Better

In the original READme it said it’s always best practice to leave the site and the code better than when you found it.

With this in mind I have made the following changes:
* Made the aside box the same level as the article box so that it’s visually in line together
* Created margins for the content inside the aside box so that it was inline with the content inside each article section.

Below is a screenshot of what the site looks like now.
